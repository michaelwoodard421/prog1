Q's for prog1:


How to pass nonce through
Is padding with nulls safe?
max title len?
How to pad and leave message unchanged
Safe to use same key, split, for hmac and password gen?

A:
Nonce can just start at 0
Dont use enncryption and mac key same
Consider splitting key
Implement padding for messages
Use aad to prevent swap and rollback attacks
store nonce in the clear 
padding: add one and then 0s
pass in none for aad
derive key from frist key 
hkdf for new keygen,hmac used derived
nonce can be same for different users, dont reuse with key, save in in serialization

TODO: 

Hash titles
Implement checksum verification
